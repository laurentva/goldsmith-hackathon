### First steps: getting it to work

* Install Python 3 from [the Python website](http://python.org). Don't forget to **ADD PYTHON TO YOUR PATH**
* Download or clone this codebase and enter a command line/terminal in there
* ```$ pip install -r requirements.txt``` 

After this you can run:
* ```$ python mqtt-general.py```

If this prints positions and doesn't throw errors, you're good to go!
